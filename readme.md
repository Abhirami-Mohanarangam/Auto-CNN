Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained a remarkable success on many image classification tasks in recent years. However, the performance of
CNNs highly relies upon their architectures. For most state-of-the-art CNNs, their architectures are often manually-designed with expertise in both
CNNs and the investigated problems. Therefore, it is difficult for users, who have no extended expertise in CNNs, to design optimal CNN architectures 
for their own image classification problems of interest. In this paper, we propose an automatic CNN architecture design method by using genetic 
algorithms, to effectively address the image classification tasks. The most merit of the proposed algorithm remains in its “automatic” characteristic 
that users do not need domain knowledge of CNNs when using the proposed algorithm, while they can still obtain a promising CNN architecture for the
given images. The proposed algorithm is validated on widely used benchmark image classification datasets, by comparing to the state-of-the-art
peer competitors covering eight manually-designed CNNs, seven automatic+manually tuning and five automatic CNN architecture design algorithms. The 
experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing automatic CNN architecture design algorithms in terms of classification 
accuracy, parameter numbers and consumed computational resources. The proposed algorithm also shows the very comparable classification 
accuracy to the best one from manually-designed and automatic+manually tuning CNNs, while consumes much less of computational resource.
